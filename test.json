    "summary": "The Expedition is a GPU benchmark for mobile devices, premium smartphones being as target devices. It offers a very demanding workload for that device range. <br>GPUScore: The Expedition measures GPU performance in a 3D mobile game scenario. It could be an action or real-time strategy game that the content represents, with a logical story line. This approach was chosen as being more representative for real games, having a logical flow from the start to the finish. <br>All GPUScore benchmarks do their benchmark runs frame based, which guarantees maximally comparable results, as the workload is made as identical as possible on all tested devices. GPUScore benchmarks also avoid hitting frame rate limits of devices by rendering 9 frames per displayed frame. Driver trickery like skipping non-rendered frames is tackled by showing clearly visible thumbnails of the frames in between in a grid strip at the bottom of the screen. Too small thumbnails could invite driver trickery.<br>The Expedition includes several different benchmark tests, or modes, which utilize the same content but different settings:<br>Official: <br>This is the primary benchmark that produces the most comparable results. This mode also submits the results of the benchmark run to Basemark’s online results platform, Powerboard 4.0. The benchmark content is always rendered at 2540x1440 resolution ‘under the hood’, even though the device’s display resolution may be different. This mode produces the most comparable measurement of the device’s GPU’s rendering performance. <br>Official Native:<br>This mode renders the content at the native resolution of the device’s display. This test offers an insight into the practical performance of the device, as applications, and sometimes even games, render at native resolution. Performance result comparisons in this mode might reveal how devices of an older generation may render the content faster than newer or higher end devices, because the higher end devices often have much higher display resolution. This test also uploads the results to Basemark’s Powerboard 4.0, but into a separate category than the Official benchmark.<br>Official VRS:<br>The Official VRS test mode renders the benchmark content at 2560x1440 resolution with same settings as the Official, but with Variable Rate Shading enabled. The results are uploaded to a separate Official VRS category on Powerboard 4.0. This mode is only available on devices with VRS hardware and driver support. <br>Custom:<br>The custom benchmark enables GPU performance benchmarking beyond the Official benchmarks above. In case you want to compare devices’ performance using another common resolution than the one used in the Official benchmark ,or you want to use lighter rendering settings for benchmarking lower end devices, this mode allows it. Lower end devices can also be benchmarked using the older benchmark, Basemark GPU, which is also available for mobile operating systems. Custom mode allows users to modify the parameters for benchmark runs. The default values, which are also the values used in the Official benchmark, are written in bold. These options are available in all versions of GPUScore: The Expedition.<br>Experience:<br>Experience mode runs the benchmark scene in time-based rendering mode. No benchmark results are produced in Experience mode as different frames may be rendered on each device, potentially even when rerunning on the same device.",

    "summary": "«English Grammar and Vocabulary» app has a new approach to English language learning. It offers users a lot of units which help them expand their grammar and vocabulary knowledge.<br><br>What do we mean by a unit? We choose an interesting topic to discuss and fill it with different activities. It can be a text, of course in English, with active words. Or it can be a list of words that will then appear in different tasks. We also find catching videos and fill them with useful information.<br><br>Another type of units is dedicated to a certain Grammar topic. We choose the most difficult and confusing grammar themes. At first we give a detailed explanation with lots of examples and then we offer users to improve new skills via exercises.<br><br>One of the most important ideas of our app is that each unit has a theory part and a part with practice. Such an approach lets users get the new material easier. And therefore — they learn English faster.<br><br>This application is an efficient way to learn English. It provides lots of tests and exercises in each unit. You can choose whether you want to learn grammar or new vocabulary today.<br><br>What’s important — you won’t find a big boring English course book inside.

All units have special marks that show a level. There are units for beginners, intermediates and advanced learners.<br><br>We have tried to choose the most popular topics that will be interesting to the majority of English learners. Space travels, universe problems, social media, job and many more.<br><br>We also choose the most necessary Grammar topics — those ones that confuse learners during their studies. But we don’t give long-read theoretical grammar articles. We divide big topics into smaller ones. Again, this helps students learn new grammar material faster.<br><br>That is why learning with «English Grammar and Vocabulary» app is an interesting, funny and efficient way to study English.<br><br>«English Grammar and Vocabulary» is a new rapidly developing app. Each week learners get new useful and engaging units with tests and exercises.

    "summary": "<b>What Is Emotional Intelligence? EQ IQ</b><br>Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.<br><br>Emotional intelligence is generally said to include at least three skills: emotional awareness, or the ability to identify and name one’s own emotions; the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes both regulating one’s own emotions when necessary and helping others to do the same.<br><br>There is no validated psychometric test or scale for emotional intelligence as there is for &quot;g,&quot; the general intelligence factor—and many argue that emotional intelligence is therefore not an actual construct, but a way of describing interpersonal skills that go by other names. <br><br>Despite this criticism, emotional intelligence (“emotional quotient,”  or &quot;EQ&quot; as it’s sometimes known) has wide appeal among the general public, as well as in certain sectors. In recent years, some employers have even incorporated emotional intelligence tests into their application or interview processes, on the theory that someone high in emotional intelligence would make a better leader or coworker.<br><br>While some studies have found a link between emotional intelligence and job performance, others have shown no correlation, and the lack of a scientifically-valid scale makes it difficult to truly measure or predict someone’s emotional intelligence on the job.<br><br><b>Signs of &quot;High EQ”</b> An emotionally intelligent individual is both highly conscious of his or her own emotional states, even negativity—frustration, sadness, or something more subtle—and able to identify and manage them.  <br><br>These people are also especially tuned in to the emotions others experience. It’s easy to see how a sensitivity to emotional signals from within and from the social environment could make one a better friend, parent, leader, or romantic partner. Fortunately, these skills can be honed.<br><br>How can you identify High EQ: <br><br>✅ primal leadership<br>✅ emotional iq<br>✅ high eq<br>✅ working with emotional intelligence<br><br><br>Main features of Emotional Intelligence app: <br><br>💗 emotional intelligence<br>💗 emotional intelligence 2.0<br>💗 emotional quotient",
