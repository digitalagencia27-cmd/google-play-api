Poio Read takes your child on an adventure where they have to master phonics to save the Readlings.<br><br>Letters and their corresponding sounds are gradually introduced as your child explores the world, and your child will use these sounds to read bigger and bigger words. The game will adapt to the child&#39;s level and every word they master will be added to a fairy-tale story, so that the child feels like they are writing the story themselves.<br><br>The goal is for your child to be able to show of their newfound skills by reading the story to you, their siblings or impressed grandparents.<br><br><br>THE POIO METHOD<br><br>Kahoot! Poio Read is a unique approach to phonics teaching, where children are in charge of their own learning journey.<br><br><br>1. Kahoot! Poio Read  is a game designed to engage your child through play and ignite their curiosity for reading.<br><br>2. The game continuously adapts to each child&#39;s level of skill, providing a sense of mastery and keeping the child motivated.<br><br>3.

It’s empty when your child starts playing. However, as the game unfolds, it will fill up with words and unravel the mysteries of the fantasy world.<br><br><br>#2 THE READLINGS<br><br>Readlings are cute bugs who eat alphabet letters. They are very picky about what they like, and have different personalities. The child controls them all!<br><br><br>#3 A TROLL<br><br>Poio, the main character of the game, catches the cute Readlings. He needs their help to read the book he has stolen from them. As they collected words at each level, children will spell them out in order to read the book.<br><br><br>#4 STRAW ISLAND<br><br>The troll and the Readlings live on an island, in the forest, a desert valley and a winter land. The goal of each straw-level is to eat as many vowels as possible and find a new word for the book. A sub goal is to rescue all the trapped Readlings. To unlock the cages where the Readings are trapped, we give children phonic tasks to practice letter sounds and spelling.<br><br><br>#5 HOUSES<br><br>For every Reading they rescue, children are rewarded with the opportunity to enter a special “house”. This gives them a break from the intense phonetics training. Here, they can use the gold coins they collect to furnish and decorate the house, while playing with the subjects and verbs of everyday objects.<br><br><br>#6 COLLECTABLE CARDS<br><br>The cards encourage children to find new things and to practice more. The board of cards also serves as a playful instruction menu for the elements in the game.<br><br>Terms and Conditions: https://kahoot.com/terms-and-conditions/<br>Privacy Policy: https://kahoot.com/privacy-policy/",4.2,4.2089553

FlixGrade the teacher app calculates a grade suggestion based on the selected grading system or in percentages (default). Seven grading systems are created.

They are not transmitted to a central server and cannot be sent or exported by e-mail. Since the data is not stored centrally on a server, it does not represent an economically interesting target for improper use.  FlixGrade the teacher app restricts itself to the most necessary data (&quot;first name&quot;, &quot;last name&quot;) and uses neutral descriptions (&quot;deviating performance assessment&quot;) in accordance with data protection requirements from the outset. All entries for a student are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. The default setting for the &quot;shelf life&quot; of the data is one year.
