An earthquake! Homes, factories, and schools have been severely damaged. Some people have been trapped in the ruins, and some have been injured. These people need rescue and other assistance! <br>Rescue preparations: <br>[Establishing rescue route] Control your drone to take snapshots of the disaster area and establish a rescue route. <br>[Tools selection] Choose from a range of more than 25 tool items, such as emergency rescue kits, ropes, electric saws and pulley blocks, etc., to create your own rescue kit that you need most for the rescue effort. <br>[Passing through the danger zone] The earthquake has made the trip through the tunnel a highly hazardous one. Watch out for the falling rocks and the crevices! <br>Aiding the injured in different scenes: <br>[At the residential building] Locate the injured with the help of detectors, and rescue them after tackling obstacles. <br>[At the school] Locate the injured with the aid of a search dog, and provide treatment to the person found. <br>[At the factory] Put out the fire at the factory, then transport important material such as food and water to the people who need them using a forklift. <br>During the earthquake rescue process, BabyBus will teach children how to escape from fires, stay safe during earthquakes, basic wound treatment, and other types of knowledge related to emergency response.

Watch as your kids play their way to improved vocabulary test scores—up to 43% in our focus group—and learn up to 1,000 new words a year with 20 minutes of gameplay per day.<br><br>From the award-winning team at Mrs Wordsmith comes Word Tag: A brand new, epic video game so fun and engaging, your child won’t want to stop playing! And since they’ll learn through gameplay, you’ll happily give in to “just 5 more minutes.”<br><br>Combining cutting-edge game design, educational research, and genuinely fun gameplay, Word Tag will help your child improve their vocabulary and become a confident reader in just 20 minutes per day. Using a tried-and-tested framework, Word Tag uses fun minigames to give kids the  exposures they need to retain vocabulary in bite-sized chunks. And from day 1, you’ll be able to see exactly what your child is learning in their personal progress report, from the syllables and synonyms to the pop quizzes and  context word games!<br><br>But though it might look like just play, it’s also a scientifically proven learning tool!  Games engage our attention because they are hands-on experiences. When we are engaged, we learn better. Stanford Research shows that information presented in a game is more likely to be learned than the same information presented in a book.<br><br>The immediate feedback, rewards, and gratification that games offer make them a groundbreaking learning device..<br>To embed the right pedagogy in the game, we brought in literacy experts to help produce our unique game-based learning approach. We are grateful to have received scientific guidance from Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).<br><br>Word Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary.  the ultimate pillar of the Science of Reading framework. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory and, ultimately, to improve reading comprehension. Kids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different games:<br><br>- Word Jumble: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word. <br>- Word Pairs: this word game reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.<br>- Words in Context: this sentence game gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.<br>- Pop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.<br><br>The order of the minigames in Word Tag is carefully scaffolded, with each minigame building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.<br><br>- What vocabulary will kids see in Word Tag? Word lists are tailored to their needs, including:<br>- Creative writing and literature words<br>- Textbook words from the Lexile database<br>- US exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)<br>- UK exam words (inc.
