Thought it would be challenging or more like the classic. It's the same thing over and over. You can even automatically roll the dice. Try it for yourself. Download and log in as a guest and play. It's honestly a bit monotonous. Graphically, it's beautiful, but that's it. Lacks a core mechanic to keep the player engaged. The dice system is just an attempt of a cash grab. There can be so many other ways to get people to buy items. I can think of 2 off the top. GLHF.","N/A","N/A",,0
