In gaming, any amounts below a ping of 20 ms are considered exceptional and “low ping,” amounts between 50 ms and 100 ms range from very good to average, while a ping of 150 ms or more is less desirable and deemed “high ping.”<br><br>✅ Download speed test<br><br>Your download speed is what you usually think of as your internet speed. This is how fast info gets from the internet to your device. It’s measured by how many bits of information can be delivered per second—usually measured in megabits per second (Mbps) or millions of bits per second.<br>Fast download speeds support better streaming, especially at higher resolutions.<br><br>✅ Upload speed test<br><br>Upload speed measures how fast data can get from your device to the internet. Like download speed, it’s also measured in Mbps.<br>Upload speed is usually slower than download speed because you usually get more info from the internet than you send to it. <br><br><b>What is the difference between download and upload speeds?</b><br><br>Download speed is how fast your internet connection can transfer data from a server to you. Download speeds are important for downloading files, loading a website, streaming a video or streaming music. Upload speed is how fast your internet connection can transfer your data to a server. Upload speeds are important for sending emails, sending files to other people, live video chats and gaming.<br><br>⬇️Download Speedtest to easily run an internet speed test and measure your internet performance by taking a free cellular or wifi speed test.<br><br>If you have questions or suggestions to this app, please email to<br>dovanhaihuong@gmail.com","4.5",4.5
