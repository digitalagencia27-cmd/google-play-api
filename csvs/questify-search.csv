This makes them easier for the eyes to watch. On the other hand, stereoscopic panoramas are much more realistic. If watching a stereoscopic panorama makes you feel dizzy, you can turn off stereoscopic mode form the settings. <br><br>No stitching errors: Utmost care is given to produce panoramas without stitching errors. Even when you look to the ground, where normally the tripod stand, you will not see any errors. This is also true for the many stereoscopic (3D) panoramas. Many will not know this but producing an error-free stereoscopic panorama of a real-life scene (not rendered), that feels right when you look at it... is very hard! Countless hours are put into making these.<br><br>Note on &quot;Gear VR&quot;: You have to pull up the USB connector and clamp the phone underneath. Don&#39;t connect the USB port as that would automatically switch the phone to the Oculus menu.<br><br>Tips:<br><br>- Move your mobile device around and see the environment as if you were holding a camera.<br>- You can use your fingers to pan around or zoom in- and out.<br>- Tap the screen to see the hotspots (if any). Tapping the hotspots will move you to that location.<br>- To prevent screen rotation keep your finger on the screen while turning the device.<br>- When in VR mode in a place, look down to exit.<br>- When in VR mode, if the scene is turning by itself, leave the device on the table for about 30 seconds. This will trigger auto-calibration of the gyroscope sensor.","Sites in VR","Ercan Gigi",N/A,"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tww3sH0EBZ1tNlt7X8t2JLbdnCulBaofAkKu6pOt5rXI8DwsVA4wRBF-wYsoKjjY5px8",4.239521,"4.2",N/A,true

Meanwhile, the band of squirrels (players on mobile) can leverage a myriad of tools and distraction tactics - including the ability to pick up and plant seeds that grow into pumpkin barriers, plant bushes to hide behind, place mushrooms they can use as leaping pads and more - while working together to develop strategies to outsmart the tree in order to scurry around and gather as many acorns as they can. <br><br>Meet the band of rebellious squirrels out to steal the golden acorns:<br>* Zip - quick witted and light-footed; she’s the fastest squirrel and has speed running abilities<br>* Chunk - the gentle giant with a heart of gold who protects his friends by carrying a shield<br>* Doug - not the smartest acorn in the bunch, but channels his rage issues to dig tunnels that allow for safe travel underground<br>* Sim - a crafty little rodent who’s kind of nutty and builds ramps for vertical movement","Acron: Attack of the Squirrels","Resolution Games AB",N/A,"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yuNG7D8E4_cpPyV8km22WAk2e2-k8I3XVSrXaZwq3bvho0kJcnOySjc4X1KrPh6zXh8",4.19,"4.2",N/A,true

As you make these purchases, an amount equal to the balance on your virtual secured credit card is also set aside in your Sesame Cash account to ensure you can make timely payments to pay off the balance on your virtual secured credit card at the end of each month, allowing you to build a positive payment history.

No translations are planned for the foreseeable future.<br><br>- This app will not let you pause work sessions or finish them early, so if you have a tiny baby-sized bladder and you need to pause every few minutes, this app is not for you. The shortest work session you can set is 10 minutes and you&#39;re not supposed to be interrupted. Also because I use this app too, and I&#39;d be the first to abuse that pause feature to go look up useless nonsense instead of getting work done.<br><br>- The purpose of this app is not to promote a healthy work-life balance, but to get you to work harder.

"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scratchjr.android","org.scratchjr.android","ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that enables young children (ages 5 and up) to create their own interactive stories and games. Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.<br><br>ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (http://scratch.mit.edu), used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children&#39;s cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.<br><br>We see coding (or computer programming) as a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.<br><br>As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just to interact with it. In the process, children learn to solve problems and design projects, and they develop sequencing skills that are foundational for later academic success. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr, children aren&#39;t just learning to code, they are coding to learn.<br><br>ScratchJr is a collaboration between the Developmental Technologies group at Tufts University, the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, and the Playful Invention Company. Two Sigma led the implementation of the Android version of ScratchJr. The graphics and illustrations for ScratchJr were created by HvingtQuatre Company and Sarah Thomson.<br><br>If you enjoy using this free app, please consider making a donation to the Scratch Foundation (http://www.scratchfoundation.org), a nonprofit organization that provides ongoing support for ScratchJr. We appreciate donations of all sizes, large and small.<br><br>This version of ScratchJr works only on tablets that are 7-inches or larger, and running Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) or higher.<br><br>Terms of Use: http://www.scratchjr.org/eula.html","ScratchJr","Scratch Foundation",N/A,"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Yi07pS-SF3w_ENRrdOvczzesQDmAAch_Kqt8pT8iYgVQ4vnLNb1Sqd2IIe4KIvTeKO0",3.7365592,"3.7",N/A,true

Improving your daily routine.<br><br>This is what you can achieve with TimeTune, your time blocking and schedule planner.<br><br><b>WHAT IS TIMETUNE?</b><br><br>TimeTune is a time blocking and daily planner application. We designed it to help you make better use of your time, increase your productivity and achieve your goals.<br><br>Have you ever wondered why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?<br><br>The answer is that they have a very organized distribution of time. They know time is a precious resource and they have strong time management habits. That’s what allows them to focus, seize the day and do everything in their agenda.<br><br>With TimeTune you can do the same.<br><br><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b><br><br>TimeTune uses time blocks to build your schedule.

This time blocking and daily schedule planner will allow you to reach your goals and is the perfect complement to your calendar.<br><br><b>WHY DOES IT WORK?</b><br><br>Time blocking is a scheduling method that divides your day into smaller segments of time for specific tasks. When you add statistics to the formula, you get the perfect system to optimize your productivity and become a master of your time.<br><br>Time blocking allows you to focus on the task at hand, avoiding distractions and procrastination. It has been proven to increase focus, motivation and productivity.<br><br>As Cal Newport, author of “Deep Work” and assistant professor of computer science at Georgetown University states:<br><br>“Time blocking generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40-hour time-blocked work week produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week without structure.”<br><br>It’s no wonder high achievers like Benjamin Franklin, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and many others embraced this planning method.<br><br>Also, for people with ADHD, time blocking might be the best single approach to tackle their tasks and avoid anxiety.

The words of the great classic turned out to be prophetic. For centuries, a brotherhood of immortal heroes held back the passage between the fantasy world of the living and the dead in the evil lands of action adventure games. But dark forces have risen from hell and filled the RPG darkest dungeon of a grim ancient castle on the outskirts of London. Demons. Vampires. Werewolves. Cthulhu. All the dark forces crave a bloody reign throughout the fantasy world in action roguelike games. All immortal mercenaries are in captivity by darkness. You are the only hero demon hunter who can clear the grim ancient dungeon teeming with evil spirits.<br><br>A hero adventure filled with endless quest, arena battles and fights with demonic bosses awaits you in action adventure games. The fantasy world is on the brink of death. Only for you depends on the fate of all mankind, because you are a hereditary immortal dark overlord.

What do you choose to fight the nations of darkness in the darkest dungeon: a Winchester, a revolver, or a Tesla gun? Or maybe you decide to use a crossbow? It&#39;s up to you. You can test your strength in the arena against other players. You won&#39;t be left alone in battle. A gargoyle, a dragon or the grim soul of fire, ice and death can come to your aid.<br><br>IDLE MERCENARIES<br>Abilities, armor, weapons and assistants need to be upgraded. To do this, you will need a huge amount of rubies. There&#39;s an easy way to earn them. After freeing the unruly imprisoned heroes, you can recruit them in stylized open world games. Rubies will accumulate while you are fighting on the other side of the darkest dungeon or standing in afk in 3D RPG.<br><br>DUNGEON LIBERATION<br>You have to go through an endless grim quest. Explore every corner of the adventure dungeon, because many dangers can lurk in the dark. You never know in what part of the ancient castle you will meet the next boss. You have to be prepared for that. You can find yourself in battle with both the Cthulhu, the Soul Eater and the Vampire Lord.<br><br>Hero Adventure: Dark RPG is a 3D roguelike game that will immerse you in the Victorian era and give you the opportunity to become a real hero of the century.
