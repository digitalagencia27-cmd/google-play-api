Poio Read is a unique approach to phonics teaching, where children are in charge of their own learning journey.<br><br><br>1. Kahoot!

It’s empty when your child starts playing. However, as the game unfolds, it will fill up with words and unravel the mysteries of the fantasy world.<br><br><br>#2 THE READLINGS<br><br>Readlings are cute bugs who eat alphabet letters. They are very picky about what they like, and have different personalities. The child controls them all!<br><br><br>#3 A TROLL<br><br>Poio, the main character of the game, catches the cute Readlings. He needs their help to read the book he has stolen from them.

The goal of each straw-level is to eat as many vowels as possible and find a new word for the book. A sub goal is to rescue all the trapped Readlings. To unlock the cages where the Readings are trapped, we give children phonic tasks to practice letter sounds and spelling.<br><br><br>#5 HOUSES<br><br>For every Reading they rescue, children are rewarded with the opportunity to enter a special “house”. This gives them a break from the intense phonetics training. Here, they can use the gold coins they collect to furnish and decorate the house, while playing with the subjects and verbs of everyday objects.<br><br><br>#6 COLLECTABLE CARDS<br><br>The cards encourage children to find new things and to practice more. The board of cards also serves as a playful instruction menu for the elements in the game.<br><br>Terms and Conditions: https://kahoot.com/terms-and-conditions/<br>Privacy Policy: https://kahoot.com/privacy-policy/,4.2,4.2089553

By varying the tasks and the ways the multiplication tables are presented, you will not only stay motivated, but get the opportunity to test your skills in different contexts.<br><br>Kahoot! Multiplication does not require you to know anything about multiplication beforehand and presents you with challenges that suit your individual level. This makes it possible for you to master the times tables completely on your own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <br><br>FEATURES<br>- A motivating and captivating game experience<br>- An innovative interface that makes the learning accessible to anyone.<br>- More than 20 different mini games to master.<br>- An adaptive progression system that ensures kids learn their times tables.<br>- No third-party advertising.<br><br>***Play at least 5 challenges per day for free***<br><br>Full access to the contents and functionality of this app requires a premium Kahoot! subscription or a one-time purchase.

The app impresses with its simple operation, a clear presentation, a large range of functions and a unique data protection concept. <br><br>Simple operation<br>- For smartphones and tablets<br>- No need to create lessons<br>- No need to create participation grades<br>A lesson begins when a class is opened and a assesment for a student is entered. All entries are simply saved with the current date. Also, grades do not have to be created beforehand for the evaluation of the participation - they can be entered directly. Other teaching services, such as a vocabulary test, are defined once and can then be used multiple times for grade entries.<br><br>Clear display<br>- All entries for a teaching day<br>- The current grade level<br>- The number of assessments<br>- Inclusive students<br>- All active checklists with processing status<br>- The last entries and remarks about the student<br>All entries start with the student, - in the seating plan or the student list, and are displayed there on a screen for the current teaching day. The following day, the entries can be found on the students&#39; detail pages. The lists and the seating plan are again free of entries. The teacher can then easily see which assessments they have entered for that day. <br><br>Large range of functions<br>- Multiple selection<br>- Series entries<br>- Group assistant<br>- Seating plan<br>- Random generator<br>- Tendency of cooperation through regression line<br>- Freely definable grading systems<br>- Calculation of suggested grades<br>- Timetable with information for organising lessons<br>- Documentation of the course of instruction as a course book<br>Entries can be made for several students at the same time. The serial input is available for the systematic evaluation of the cooperation. A group assistant puts together groups that are homogeneous in terms of performance and facilitates the organisation of lessons during group work. All entries can also be made in the seating plan. FlixGrade the teacher app calculates a grade suggestion based on the selected grading system or in percentages (default). Seven grading systems are created. In addition, you can define your own grading systems. The tendency of the participation grades is clearly shown with a regression line. The course of the lesson and important information are clearly displayed in the teacher calendar. <br><br>New data protection concept<br>- Minimal data framework<br>- Encrypted data<br>- No central server<br>- Automatic deletion<br>The teacher app Flixgrade has a comprehensive data protection concept in accordance with the European Data Protection Act. The student data remains on the mobile device. With current operating systems, they are stored there in encrypted form. They are not transmitted to a central server and cannot be sent or exported by e-mail. Since the data is not stored centrally on a server, it does not represent an economically interesting target for improper use.  FlixGrade the teacher app restricts itself to the most necessary data (&quot;first name&quot;, &quot;last name&quot;) and uses neutral descriptions (&quot;deviating performance assessment&quot;) in accordance with data protection requirements from the outset. All entries for a student are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. The default setting for the &quot;shelf life&quot; of the data is one year. This makes it easier to work safely and, as far as I know, is an absolutely unique feature for a teacher&#39;s calendar.<br><br>FlixGrade - the teacher app is free for up to three study groups and 80 students. In addition it can be activated for as many students and classes as desired through an in-app purchase  (approx. € 1 per month).<br><br>Have fun with the teacher&#39;s calendar, teacher&#39;s planner, course book and digital grade book for teachers.<br><br>Best wishes by Stefan Heizmann,0.0,0
