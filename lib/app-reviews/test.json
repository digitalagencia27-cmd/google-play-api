Raven, who developed them in 1936 as a non-verbal test of abstract thinking.<br>It is a ‘culture fair’ multiple choice IQ test, that measures your fluid intelligence (Gf) – your reasoning and problem solving ability. Fluid intelligence is a core component of (g) – your general intelligence.<br>This test tests the understanding of the complexity of patterns, the ability to store and retrieve information. It provides insight into the ability to observe, solve problems and learn.<br>The test measures only a subset of intellectual abilities. Based on this, valid conclusions can not be drawn about the overall intelligence of the person, the results are approximate.<br><br>How does it work?<br><br>The test consists of 54 questions which in turn are gradually more complex. Respondents choose geometric shapes to properly complete larger images.<br>The result of the test is determined by the number of correct answers and the age of the respondent. However, the final score is not linearly related to the number of correct answers.<br>The evaluation of the test is based on a study of a large sample of anonymous results of users of the app in different age categories and is continuously refined.<br>The results are distributed on the so-called Gaussian curve into several percentile intervals on an overall scale from 0 to 160 intelligence quotient points, with the majority of the population according to the Gaussian curve (i.e. over 50%) corresponds to IQ values between 90 and 110.<br><br>Advantages and Disadvantages<br><br>• The advantage of the test is its non-verbal nature, which avoids cultural and linguistic discrepancies.<br>• The disadvantage of the test is that repeating it may improve the result.",

This is how fast info gets from the internet to your device.

In recent years, some employers have even incorporated emotional intelligence tests into their application or interview processes, on the theory that someone high in emotional intelligence would make a better leader or coworker.<br><br>While some studies have found a link between emotional intelligence and job performance, others have shown no correlation, and the lack of a scientifically-valid scale makes it difficult to truly measure or predict someone’s emotional intelligence on the job.<br><br><b>Signs of &quot;High EQ”</b> An emotionally intelligent individual is both highly conscious of his or her own emotional states, even negativity—frustration, sadness, or something more subtle—and able to identify and manage them.  <br><br>These people are also especially tuned in to the emotions others experience.

The detailed results include your strengths, weaknesses, celebrity types, and much more!<br>- The simple IQ test results show you a range of your IQ and a calculation of whether you are average, above average, or a genius!<br><br>Objective of IQ tests: IQ is a concept that is used to measure some defined skills of people. The IQ ranking is made from a relative point of view. In other words, some variables are used and then an intelligence test is made. This intelligence test is made in a way that measures the IQ of a person in those areas. It is very difficult to make an IQ test that truly takes a person&#39;s absolute true intelligence. However, by taking a common statistic (for example language, or counting), we can make an IQ test that measures people&#39;s intelligence. Scientists approach IQ measuring tests in a similar way. By taking common variables as the core statistic, a general IQ test can be made that measures the IQ of a huge portion of the population. <br><br>More important information regarding the calculation of IQ score &gt;&gt; IQ scores are highly relative when it comes to measurement. Imagine a system in which grading and measurement is done based on some variables. These variables are constructed by some experts based on certain assumptions. These assumptions lie at the core of calculation of IQ. So, people whose lives are not surrounded by the implications of these assumptions will be worse off when it comes to the test. In other words, you cannot calculate the IQ of an elephant in the same way you would with a kangaroo. Therefore, IQ scores are highly relative and up to a great amount of discussion. With this in mind, we have put multiple IQ tests in one test so that people can choose which type of IQ score they would like to test themselves in. <br><br>Important Note: IQ Test - Intelligence Test is aimed to be fun, entertaining, and educating. Under no circumstances the user should think that this is absolutely representative of his true intelligence and character. Enjoy it!",

    "summary": "The Expedition is a GPU benchmark for mobile devices, premium smartphones being as target devices. It offers a very demanding workload for that device range. <br>GPUScore: The Expedition measures GPU performance in a 3D mobile game scenario. It could be an action or real-time strategy game that the content represents, with a logical story line. This approach was chosen as being more representative for real games, having a logical flow from the start to the finish. <br>All GPUScore benchmarks do their benchmark runs frame based, which guarantees maximally comparable results, as the workload is made as identical as possible on all tested devices. GPUScore benchmarks also avoid hitting frame rate limits of devices by rendering 9 frames per displayed frame. Driver trickery like skipping non-rendered frames is tackled by showing clearly visible thumbnails of the frames in between in a grid strip at the bottom of the screen. Too small thumbnails could invite driver trickery.<br>The Expedition includes several different benchmark tests, or modes, which utilize the same content but different settings:<br>Official: <br>This is the primary benchmark that produces the most comparable results. This mode also submits the results of the benchmark run to Basemark’s online results platform, Powerboard 4.0. The benchmark content is always rendered at 2540x1440 resolution ‘under the hood’, even though the device’s display resolution may be different. This mode produces the most comparable measurement of the device’s GPU’s rendering performance. <br>Official Native:<br>This mode renders the content at the native resolution of the device’s display. This test offers an insight into the practical performance of the device, as applications, and sometimes even games, render at native resolution. Performance result comparisons in this mode might reveal how devices of an older generation may render the content faster than newer or higher end devices, because the higher end devices often have much higher display resolution. This test also uploads the results to Basemark’s Powerboard 4.0, but into a separate category than the Official benchmark.<br>Official VRS:<br>The Official VRS test mode renders the benchmark content at 2560x1440 resolution with same settings as the Official, but with Variable Rate Shading enabled. The results are uploaded to a separate Official VRS category on Powerboard 4.0. This mode is only available on devices with VRS hardware and driver support. <br>Custom:<br>The custom benchmark enables GPU performance benchmarking beyond the Official benchmarks above. In case you want to compare devices’ performance using another common resolution than the one used in the Official benchmark ,or you want to use lighter rendering settings for benchmarking lower end devices, this mode allows it. Lower end devices can also be benchmarked using the older benchmark, Basemark GPU, which is also available for mobile operating systems. Custom mode allows users to modify the parameters for benchmark runs. The default values, which are also the values used in the Official benchmark, are written in bold. These options are available in all versions of GPUScore: The Expedition.<br>Experience:<br>Experience mode runs the benchmark scene in time-based rendering mode. No benchmark results are produced in Experience mode as different frames may be rendered on each device, potentially even when rerunning on the same device.",
