Our camera algebra calculator shows you all steps of the solution as well as explanations to any math textbook problem you enter. This camera calculator app solves math homework problems just like your teacher! Explanations will tell you not only which algebra rule is being used, but also how it is applied in your particular math problem. Snap the problem picture or enter it via user friendly math keyboard to get instant steps and solution!<br><br>Fraction calculator will show steps to add, subtract and multiply fractions, as well as complex fraction division. After reducing fractions or rational numbers to simplest terms, fraction to decimal calculator will assist you with converting fractions to percentages. Lowest common denominator (lcm, lcd) calculator will help make equivalent fractions. Simplifying fractions also includes rationalizing denominators and numerators.<br>Graphing calculator will graph lines, horizontal and vertical asymptotes, x and y intercepts. It will produce graphs of quadratic equations, functions and parabola equations, linear equations (lines) and inequalities, trig. functions (e.g. cos graph) and curves such as hyperbola and circle equations. The graphing calculator math app will also show fractions on the number line, find the slope of a line as well as a parabola vertex. After placing polynomials in standard form, it will graph any polynomial function. Many other functions such as logarithmic, exponential and absolute value can also be graphed.<br>Equations and inequalities can be solved by several math equation solvers (e.g. quadratic equation calculator, linear equations calculator and system of equations solver (solving by substitution and addition)). Quadratic calculator will put a quadratic equation in standard form and then either use quadratic formula or solve by factoring. Logarithmic, rational, exponential, linear and quadratic equation solver will solve for x or any other math variable. Systems of linear equations and inequalities will be graphed to produce visually appealing math solution. Linear inequalities, polynomial equations, absolute value equations and inequalities are all solved by our algebra solver that shows work just like your teacher.<br>Factoring solver can factor polynomials, trinomials and binomials. It will factor quadratic equation so that it can be solved by the equation solver. Many different factoring methods such as factoring by grouping, difference of two squares, difference of two cubes, sum of two cubes are used. Greatest Common Factor calculator and perfect square trinomials are also used in the polynomial factoring calculator.<br>Trigonometry solver simplifies algebraic expressions with trig functions (such as sin or cos). It knows special values on trig unit circle (e.g. cos 0, sin 0, cos 1, sin 1, cos 30, sin 30, cos 45, sin 45, cos 90, sin 90). Sin cos tan and other trig functions can be simplified and graphed.<br>Exponents calculator applies exponent power rules and laws of exponents. It multiplies and divides fractional and negative exponents, using the properties of exponents. It also knows logarithm rules to apply to logarithmic functions.<br>Simplify expression calculator can simplify any algebraic or math expression, showing you all the step in the process. This includes complex numbers and imaginary numbers that are handled by calculator for complex numbers.<br>Radical simplifier includes cube and square root solver.<br>Square root properties are used while solving radical equations and simplifying radical expressions.<br>Matrix solver can multiply matrices, find inverse matrix and perform other matrix operations.

Children snap together graphical programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. Children can modify characters in the paint editor, add their own voices and sounds, even insert photos of themselves -- then use the programming blocks to make their characters come to life.<br><br>ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language (http://scratch.mit.edu), used by millions of young people (ages 8 and up) around the world. In creating ScratchJr, we redesigned the interface and programming language to make them developmentally appropriate for younger children, carefully designing features to match young children&#39;s cognitive, personal, social, and emotional development.<br><br>We see coding (or computer programming) as a new type of literacy. Just as writing helps you organize your thinking and express your ideas, the same is true for coding. In the past, coding was seen as too difficult for most people. But we think coding should be for everyone, just like writing.<br><br>As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, not just to interact with it. In the process, children learn to solve problems and design projects, and they develop sequencing skills that are foundational for later academic success. They also use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context, supporting the development of early-childhood numeracy and literacy. With ScratchJr, children aren&#39;t just learning to code, they are coding to learn.<br><br>ScratchJr is a collaboration between the Developmental Technologies group at Tufts University, the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, and the Playful Invention Company. Two Sigma led the implementation of the Android version of ScratchJr. The graphics and illustrations for ScratchJr were created by HvingtQuatre Company and Sarah Thomson.<br><br>If you enjoy using this free app, please consider making a donation to the Scratch Foundation (http://www.scratchfoundation.org), a nonprofit organization that provides ongoing support for ScratchJr. We appreciate donations of all sizes, large and small.<br><br>This version of ScratchJr works only on tablets that are 7-inches or larger, and running Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) or higher.<br><br>Terms of Use: http://www.scratchjr.org/eula.html",
